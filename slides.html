        ## What is programming?

        * Programming is basically giving instructions to your computer in a form that it can understand
        * Computers need *very specific* instructions
        * Programming languages have syntax, just like human languages have grammar rules

        <br>
        ### Why Python Is Awesome

        *   Free!
        *   Open source
        *   Write once, run anywhere
        *   Great community
        *   The syntax looks similar to English
        *   Meaningful errors, easy to debug

        ## Running Python in PyCharm

        The console is an interactive tool used to test and debug code and is included in PyCharm! Let&rsquo;s open the console:

        ![Tools &gt; Python Console&hellip;](./framework/img/workshop/open-console1.png)

        The console will pop up at the bottom of the application. Type code (instructions) after the green `>>>` symbol. This symbol is used to represent a space to enter your input but you don&rsquo;t have to actually type it.

        ![Python Console in PyCharm](./framework/img/workshop/open-console2.png)

        **Pro tip!** You can also open and close the console by selecting the icon in the lower left of PyCharm.

      <script type="text/template">
        ## Python can do math

        In the console, after the `>>>`, try out these examples.

        The command you input after the `>>>` gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

        ```
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> 2 * 15
        30
        ```

        ```
        >>> 1 / 2
        0
        ```
        Why is `1 / 2 = 0`? We&rsquo;ll come back to that.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Data Types

        The previous example used the *integer* number **type** but there are many more.

        * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
        * Float (`float`, numbers containing decimals)
        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (`True`, `False`)
        * [and many more!](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html)

        To display the type, use `type()` and a data value inside the parentheses.

        ```
        >>> type("hello")
        <type 'str'>

        >>> type(42)
        <type 'int'>

        >>> type(3.14159)
        <type 'float'>
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Functions

        * Functions are bundles of instructions that can be re-used
        * Reusing functions helps to reduce redundancy
        * Function can take **arguments** and can **return** values

        e.g. the `add` function takes `a` and `b` as arguments and will **return** the result

        ```python
        >>> def add(a, b):
        ...     return a + b
        ...
        >>> add(1, 2)
        3
        >>> add(3, 4)
        7
        ```

        It is possible to create your own but today's exercises will use functions provided by Python and its libraries.

      <script type="text/template">
        ## Printing

        The `print()` **function** outputs values to the screen.

        Note the syntax in the examples. Quotes should be included when using a *string* data type.

        ```
        >>> print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```
        >>> print(2 + 2)
        4
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Concatenation
        **Concatenation** is used to "add" strings together by joining multiple strings into one.
        ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        <br>
        But what if we try to join a string and a number?

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Why did that error happen?

        Python needs to know the data **type** to work with it.

        Let&rsquo;s look at that error again.

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```

        <br>
        The first `2` is an integer and the second `"2"` is a **string** type.

        Python can&rsquo;t figure out how to add a number and string, so it spits out an error.

      </script>
    </section>

<!-- -------------------- -->
<!--Typecasting-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting

        In Python, you can *change the type*.

        In this example, the `int()` function can be used to convert the `"2"` string into a number.

        ```
        >>> print(2 + int("2"))
        4
        ```

        <br>
        Remember the `1/2 = 0` example? When Python divides two integers, it rounds the result down to the nearest integer (in this case 0).

        Integer **types** are whole numbers (no decimals), so to be more precise, `float()` can be used to include decimals.
        ```
        >>> print(float(1) / float(2))
        0.5
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting (Continued)

        Python can also be used to convert numbers to strings. This example below will return an error.  Why?

        ```
        >>> print(99 + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```

        <br>
        Use the `str()` function to convert a number to a string.

        ```
        >>> print(str(99) + " bottles of beer on the wall")

        ```

        <br>
        The ability to tell Python to change the type will come in handy later.

<!-- -------------------- -->
<!--Variables-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Variables
        * Used to store a value to use whenever you need it
        * Variables store data in the computer&rsquo;s memory and a **variable name** is used to fetch their value (kind of like a bookmark in a book)
        * Use the equal (`=`) symbol to *assign* a value to a variable

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x * y
        20
        ```

        ```python
        >>> today = "Saturday"
        >>> print("Today is " + today)
        Today is Saturday
        ```
        You can store almost anything in a variable.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after the initial declaration by "reassigning" them.

        ```python
        # Remember, we've already set x = 5 and y = 4
        >>> y = 10
        >>> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be? <span class="delayed">50</span>

        Why?<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        You changed <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`y`, but the old value of `x` is still in memory.
        Python will remember variable names until you close PyCharm or [clear them manually](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement).
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide list-font-default" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## What's in a name?

        Here are some tips & best practices for creating variable names:

        * variable names can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`)
          * no spaces!
        * separate words with the underscore `_` symbol
          * e.g. `ladies_learning_code`
        * they cannot begin with a number
          * `1day` gives you an error, `day1` will work.
        * use descriptive names
          * e.g. `first_name` is more descriptive than `fn`
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Pro Tip! Use Comments

        Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future)

        Good comments add information that isn&rsquo;t immediately obvious.

        You can also use comments to organize your code or to "hide" chunks of code you don't want to delete but are not ready to use yet. Feel free to add your own throughout the exercises!

        Note the syntax below:

        ```
        # Python will ignore anything after the # symbol
        ```

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World


        As a first project, let's have Python say hello


        ```python
        print("Hello, World!")

        ```

        Should look something like this:
        ```python
        >>> print("Hello, World!")
        Hello, World!

        ```


      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World

        Instead of just a 'Hello World' message on the screen, take it one step further and have Python say hello to anyone!

        The function `raw_input` in Python 2 (or `input` if you have installed Python 3) will get the data input by the user and **return* the value back to you.

        1. Give input function a message to let the user know what information is being requested using this syntax (note the quotes):

          Python 2
          ```python
          >>> raw_input("What's your name?")
          ```

          Python 3
          ```python
          >>> input("What's your name?")
          ```

        1. The user types a response and hits the **enter** key
        1. Whatever the user types is **returned** to you.

        Try it in your console. It will look something like this:

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 2)

        Using the console is great for testing smaller chunks of code but there is a better way. Python can run code from a file with a `.py` file **extension**. Let&rsquo;s create a Python file!

        1. Right-click (or two-finger tap) on the **exercises** folder to create a new file. Then select **New > Python File**

          ![Create a new Python File](./framework/img/workshop/new-file-mac.png)

        1. Enter the name `ex1_hello_world.py` in the popup box.

          ![new python file name](framework/img/workshop/new-python-file.png)

        1. Add the below program/code snippet to the file. Try to practice typing it out to get used to the syntax. Use this example as a reference rather than copy-paste.

          Reminder, anything after the `#` symbol is just a comment.

          Python 2:
          ```python
          # Assign the raw_input value to a variable
          # Your program waits for the user to hit enter
          name = raw_input("Please enter your name: ")

          # ... then continues to this line
          print("Hello " + name)
          ```

          Python 3:
          ```python
          # Assign the input value to a variable
          # Your program waits for the user to hit enter
          name = input("Please enter your name: ")

          # ... then continues to this line
          print("Hello " + name)
          ```

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 3)

        Code in a **.py** file is just text until you **run** it through the Python program.

        1. To run the code, select the green arrow symbol. PyCharm automatically saves your file before you run it.

          ![](framework/img/workshop/pycharm-run.png)

          You can also find it in the menu under **View > Tool Windows > Run**

        1. The code will run in your console window. Type your name and press the **Enter** key to see your response repeated back at you.

      <script type="text/template">
        ## Conditionals &amp; Logic
        The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom. What if the program could decide what to do instead?  `if` statements can be used to execute different sets of instructions based on specific conditions.

        Each `if` statement contains a test. The indented block is the code that will run if the test is `True` and looks something like this:

        ```python
        # Not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        else:
            dress normally :)
        ```

        You can also have more than one condition.

        ```python
        # Still not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        elif it is raining:
            bring an umbrella
        else:

        ## Boolean values

        How does `if` know what&rsquo;s `True` or `False`? Use 'Boolean' statements to test against the values.

        Reminder, one equals symbol only *assigns* a value to the variable.

        ```python
        >>> weather = "raining"
        ```

        The double equals symbol (`==`) will compare 2 values.

        Is the value inside the variable `weather` the same as the string `"cold"`?
        ```
        >>> weather == "cold"
        False
        >>> weather == "raining"
        True
        ```

        ## Exercise 2: Weather (10 mins)

        Create a new file named `ex2_weather_advice.py`.

        Use the code snippet below as a reference but try to type it out rather than copy-paste to get used to the syntax.

        Note the whitespace. Python uses indentation to signify which block of code belongs inside the `if` or `else`.

        ```python
        # file: ex2_weather_advice.py
        ```

        ```python
        # Python 2:
        weather = raw_input("What is the weather? (cold, raining, etc.)")
        ```

        ```python
        # Python 3:
        weather = input("What is the weather? (cold, raining, etc.)")
        ```

        ```python
        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        elif weather == "raining":
            print("Bring an umbrella")
        else:
            print("Dress normally :)")

        # Lists

        When we have collections of similar things, we might store them in a **list**

        ```python
        weather_conditions = ['rainy', 'snowing', 'cloudy','sunny','foggy']

        ```

        ```python

        prime_numbers = [2,3,5,7,11,13]

        ```

        In python, the items in the list can be different data types.

        ```python

         weather_conditions = ['rainy', 'snowing', 'cloudy','sunny','foggy']

        # Loops

        One of the most powerful tools we have as programmers is having a computer repeat the same instruction for us many times.

        Python can access each item in a list in order, and do something with each item.

        ```python
        my_list = ['some','items']
        for member in my_list:
           # do something
           # python will do all of this indented code for each item

        weather_conditions = ['rainy', 'snowing', 'cloudy','sunny','foggy']

        for condition in weather_conditions:
            print(condition)

        Perform some math on each item in the list:
        ```python
        numbers = [5,11,66,22.5]

        for number in numbers:
           result = number * 2

        ## Counting

        As python accesses each item in a list, we can tell it to count how many items it has found.

        We can add `1` to the current value of a variable, and assign it back to the same variable. Python processes everything to the right of the `=` before assigning the result.

        Count the number of items on your to-do list:

        ```python
        number_of_todos = 0
        to_do_list = ['Water plants', 'Clean bathroom','Sweep floors','Buy Coffee','Organise books','Write a novel']

        for todos in to_do_list:
            number_of_todos = number_of_todos + 1

        ## Opening a file

        Open the file called `working_with_files.py`.

        Computer data is often stored in files such **.csv** (comma-separated values) files.
        These file types are used to represent spreadsheet-like data.

        Let's look at the example below to see how to open these files in Python and print the contents to the screen.

        When you open a file using the "with" syntax, that creates a new block and the file will be closed automatically for you as soon as you exit the block.

        ```python
        with open('llc-chapters.csv') as chapters:
            print(chapters.read())

        ```

        ## Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        To make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.
        In the `llc-chapters.csv` file, each line of the file represents a Ladies Learning Code chapter.

        Let&rsquo;s try printing out a few individual lines using the example below.

        ```python
        with open('llc-chapters.csv') as chapters:
            print(chapters.readline())
            print(chapters.readline())
            print(chapters.readline())

        ## One line at a time

        In the previous slide we printed out three lines in the file, one at a time.
        Notice that all three lines have exactly three values, separated by a comma.

        ```
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan
        Calgary,AB,Darcie
        ```

        * the first line shows the headings that describe the data in the next lines
        * the second and third line each represent one of the LLC chapter cities & the name of the chapter lead

        That's because it's pulling the data from the rows & columns of the CSV file.

        Here's some sample code:

        Instead, **import** the functions and other structures from a **module** to use that code without actually adding all of that code into your file.

        ## Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV library has a number of different tools for extracting data from a CSV file. Instead of a line of comma-separated values like in the previous example, we can access individual values (like the cells of a spreadsheet).

        Today we&rsquo;ll mostly use the `DictReader` tool to access the values.

        1. import the `csv` library
        1. open the file
        1. pass the file into `DictReader`

        ```
        import csv
        with open('llc-chapters.csv') as chapters_file:
            chapters_data = list(csv.DictReader(chapters_file))
        ```

        Now, print the first line

        ```
            chapter = chapters_data[0]
            print(chapter)
        ```

        What is this?
        ```python
        {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
           ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Dictionaries

        Python used `DictReader` to read a row in the file and transform it into a **dictionary**, a bunch of *key: value pairs*.

        This is just like a regular dictionary:
         > **[python](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/python)** : any of several Old World boa constrictors of the subfamily Pythoninae, often growing to a length of more than 20 feet

         The console printed out `chapter` like this:
          ```python
        {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
           ```

        But think of it like this:
        > **City**: 'Vancouver'

        > **Chapter Lead(s)**: 'Meghan'

        >  **Province**: 'BC'

        What headings did this CSV have (what keys does this dictionary have)?

        ```python
        print(chapter.keys())
        ```

        Python can 'look up' each value in a row just as you would the meaning of the word *python*.

        ```python
        print(chapter['City'])
        print(chapter['Province'])

        * group instructions together with the same indentation
        * all the instructions in the indented block are run for each `chapter`

        ## Exercise 6: Find chapters with co-leads (15 mins)

        In the **llc-chapters.csv** file, the `&` character is used to separate the co-lead names.

        You can use `in` to figure out which cities have co-leads. For example:

        ```python
         leads = "Nancy & Cassie"
         if "&" in leads:
             print(leads + " are co-leads")

        ```

        Create a new file called `ex6_coleaders.py` and use what you've learned so far to figure out which chapter cities have co-leads.

        * Print a list of cities with co-leads
        * Count how many chapters have co-leads

        So far, we've used small examples to practice using CSV files and recognizing patterns.

        In 2015, Ladies Learning Code had nearly 6500 participants and volunteers involved in events (and not accounting for people who attended multiple events). Do you want to count those?

        ## Exercise 7

        In order to promote **National Learn to Code Day**, and measure its
        success relative to 2015, we'll need some stats:

        * number of people signed up for "National Learn to Code Day"
        * total number of people registered for "Kids Learning Code" or
        "Girls Learning Code" events

        1. Sort the list of attendees in the CSV by last name.
        1. Find out how many attendees will be coming.
        1. *Bonus* Given 3 volunteers, how can we divide up the names into 3 groups?

        # Final Exercise

        ## Let's take what we've learned so far and write a Pig Latin translator.
        <br />
        Pig Latin is a language game, where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add "ay." So "Python" becomes "ythonpay." To write a Pig Latin translator in Python, here are the steps we'll need to take:

        1. Ask the user to input a word in English.
        1. Make sure the user entered a valid word (refuse to "translate" blank inputs)
        1. Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.
        1. Display the translation result.

        ```python
        # Let's get some user input!
        user_input = input()  # raw_input() if you are using python2
        # Make sure they enter a valid word. We should just be checking for non alpha characters

        if user_input is only alpha characters:
          # Convert the word to Pig Latin. This is done by moving the first letter of the
          # word (hint! use slicing) to the end and then appending 'ay'.
          # E.g. Python becomes ythonpay
          # Print out the translated word!
      else:
        # Print an error to let the user know they have entered an invalid word.

      # Bonus round!
      # If the word starts with a vowel, append 'ay' without changing the order of the letters.
